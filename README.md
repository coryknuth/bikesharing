# NYC Bikesharing Analysis

In order to determine the likelihood for a bikesharing business to succeed in Iowa, we analyzed New York Cities' bikesharing data. We looked at data including ride couunts, rider gender and subscription status, peak ride times and locations, and more. Here are some of the findings.

## Results

### Starting/Ending Locations
One of the things we analyzed were the most popular starting and ending locations. We found that the most used starting and ending points are very simliar. It seems to indicate that on average people don't ride a great distance from start to finish, that they return to where they started from, or some combination of the two.

### Ride Lengths
We also noticed from the data that total ride durations on average tend to be very short, with most being around the 5 minutes mark.

### Peak Riding Times
The data show us that peak riding times are just before working hours in the morning at about 8-9am, and just after working hours in the evening at around 5-6pm. Weekdays have a much higher share of total rides than weekends, indicating strong portion of the rider base may be using the bikes to commute to and from work, or just doing their daily rides before or after work.

### Rider Gender
We also see from the data that a majority of the riders are Men.

## Summary

After analyzing our results, it seems well supported that a strong portion of the bikesharing users from the New York data are commuters using the bikes to get to and from work. It would help the new Iowa bikesharing business in the early stages of launching to focus on building stations around business districts in the city, as well as population centers, allowing people to use the bikes for their daily commute. This would provide a good initial, loyal customer base to facilitate growth. 

For further analysis, we would recommend looking into individual bike usage statistics and repair costs and statistics to help develop and initial budget for bike upkeep and maintenence.
